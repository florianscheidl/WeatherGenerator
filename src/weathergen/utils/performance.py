    Reads the CUDA caching allocator's high-water marks (``max_memory_allocated``
    and ``max_memory_reserved``) at each ``collect()`` call, reduces them across
    all ranks with MAX, and resets the peak stats so every call reports the peak
    since the previous one.

    On top of the per-window peak, ``collect()`` also reports running maxima over
    all windows closed so far: ``<window>_global`` (the high-water mark of that
    window label alone, e.g. the worst training interval up to now) and ``global``
    (the run-wide high-water mark across every window label). Both are accumulated
    from the already-reduced values, so they are identical on all ranks. They are
    not derivable downstream from a single record — the windows are logged into
    separate records — which is why they are emitted here.

    ``max_memory_allocated`` is the peak of memory occupied by live tensors
    (parameters, gradients, optimizer states, activations) — the model's actual
    demand, comparable to analytic memory estimates. ``max_memory_reserved`` is
    the peak of memory the caching allocator has claimed from the device via
    cudaMalloc; it also counts cached blocks that are currently free but not
    returned to CUDA, so reserved >= allocated and the gap measures
    fragmentation / caching slack. An OOM is raised when a new cudaMalloc
    fails, so reserved (plus non-PyTorch usage such as NCCL buffers and cuBLAS
    workspaces, which neither counter sees) is what determines headroom against
    the device's capacity.
